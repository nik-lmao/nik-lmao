<h1>👋 Hey there!</h1>

⚡️ **I am Nikita (he/him)** - I'm a developer from Germany. I actually have no idea when I started coding. My first real project was a game on scratch in 2020. I was 10 years old back then. I eventually started learning python for coding discord bots with discord.py and continued with a little bit of Lua (for Roblox development), HTML/CSS and Javascript.
